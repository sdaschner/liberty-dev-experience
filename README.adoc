== Open Liberty developer experience

=== Experimental Docker support

To try out the Docker support, run the following:

----
./docker-prepare.sh
./docker-run.sh
----

After the Docker container has started, run the following in a new terminal session:

----
./liberty-dev.sh
----

Following assumptions are made in the project and container structure:

- The `<finalName>` in the `pom.xml` `<build>` is set to the deployment artifact (tested with WAR files)
- `<applicationManager autoExpand="true"/>` is defined in `server.xml`
- Liberty home is under `/opt/ol/wlp` (matches the official `open-liberty` images)


=== Known limitations

- Permissions: currently setting file mode to `777` for `target/liberty/wlp`, since Docker container runs with different user
- Tests are not executed against the updated classes, since the compiled classes now reside under `<server-dir>/apps/expanded/.../WEB-INF/classes`.
This needs to be fixed.
