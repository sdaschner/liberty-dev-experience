== Open Liberty developer experience

How to maximize your Enterprise Java developer experience with Open Liberty.


=== Build and run

You can build the application as follows:

----
$> mvn clean package
$> docker build -t test .
$> docker run --rm -p 9080:9080 test
----

You can accessing the application as follows:

----
$> curl localhost:9080/hello/greetings/hi
----


=== Liberty dev mode

----
$> mvn liberty:dev
----

Access the application in a different terminal session, and change the `*.java` source files.

----
$> curl localhost:9080/hello/greetings/hi
----


=== Hot-deployment with Kubernetes

Deploy the application onto a Kubernetes &amp; Istio cluster:

----
$> kubectl apply -f deployment/
----

You can swap the created deployment using https://telepresence.io[Telepresence^].
Afterwards, accessing the Kubernetes cluster will direct you to the locally running process.

----
$> kubectl get deployments
NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
hello-world   1/1     1            1           1m

$> telepresence --swap-deployment hello-world --expose 9080

# in a new terminal
$> mvn liberty:dev
----
